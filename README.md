## Overview
- The Poker Engine program is written in C++, aiming to run fast simulations compatible with poker theory research
- This project is a stepping stone to the development of a CFR HULHE solver

## Development Timeline
- Started development in December 2024
- Since then have reduced game simulation runtimes from an average of 33126.4ns from 119687.5ns (72.3% performance improvement)
- Working on developing efficient hand evaluation to further optimize runtime
- Currently enabling library support, also expanding on testing

## Technologies
- C++
- CMake
- GCC/GNU Debugger
- conan
