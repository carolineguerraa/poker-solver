## Overview
- The Poker Solver program is written in C++ and Python, and aims to provide meaningful feedback and analysis on actions within Heads-Up Texas No-Limit Hold'em Poker.
- This project is currently a work in progress - it is currently able to simulate the game but not provide any feedback. 

## Technologies (presently)
- C++
- Python
- pybind11
- CMake
- GCC/GNU Debugger
- conan
- poetry

## Next Steps
- We will be effectively calculating opponent ranges based on position and bet sizing.
- We will be simulating and calculate basic poker mathematical concepts such as equity, pot odds, implied odds, and reverse implied odds.
- We will potentially be experimenting with RL techniques using PyTorch.
